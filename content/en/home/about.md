My name is **Brandon Williams** and I am a learning biologist and ecologist committed to research and the application and enrichment of these subjects for future generations. I am also an avid fly fisher, fly tyer,and love learning about lake entomoloogy, freshwater ecology and limnology.  I am a steward of the earths ecosystems and am motivated by the vision of being able to pass on the same experiences to my children as I have had with nature. I am a self motivated, driven, and self starting individual that has the capacity to lead others,inspire and think creatively.


### Education


#### MSc in Environmental Science Candidate, 2019 - Ongoing

I am currently completing a thesis based Masters of Science in Environmental Science at Thompson Rivers University, B.C., Canada. My research is examining the use of prescribed burning as a tool to shift a reclaimed mine tailings storage facility dominated by agronomic grass to a native plant community. This research is primarily focused on reclamation and restoration efforts to enhance ecosystem function.

Additionally, this work involves a collaboration between TECK operations, and Nlaka'pamux First Nation of B.C. This partnership is allowing me to extend my research capacity outside of the biological realm by conducting traditional social research that is to be incorporated into my thesis on how to foster positive relationships between industry and Indigenous communities.

#### BSc Majoring in Biology, Minor in Business, 2014 - 2019

I completed my undergraduate studies at Macewan University, AB, Canada. Majoring in Biology I focused primarily on zoological and ecological sciences while completing my capstone course on contemporary issues in frewshwater ecology. I also completed a minor in Business studies where I studied cost and financial accounting, upper level finance courses, and organizational management.
